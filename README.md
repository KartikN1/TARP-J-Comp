# TARP-J-Comp
# Lightweight Facemask Detection

* With this project we aim to make a tool which will be able to detect if a person is wearing a mask properly covering the vital areas of nose and mouth.
* Then based on the results of the AI we will be able to trigger further actions such as open the door, or send an alert message saying that the mask isnâ€™t worn properly or not worn at all.
* This project is based on live video stream which acts as an input which is then feed to the AI and then after predictions are made
* The project also covers the situations where one can analye recorded video.
